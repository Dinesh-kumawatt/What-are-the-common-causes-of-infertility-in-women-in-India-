Infertility is becoming more common in India, and many women face it silently due to stigma or lack of awareness. But the truth is, infertility is just a medical condition—and like any other health issue, it can be treated. Knowing the common causes of infertility in women helps in taking action early and getting the right help.

Here are the most common reasons:

1. PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome):
This is the leading cause of infertility in Indian women. It affects hormone levels, causes irregular periods, and stops eggs from releasing properly. Many women with PCOS also face weight gain, acne, and mood swings. With diet, medication, and sometimes IVF, pregnancy is still very possible.

2. Endometriosis:
This is when tissue that should be inside the uterus starts growing outside. It causes pain during periods and sex, and it can block the fallopian tubes or damage the ovaries. Endometriosis is common but often missed. It can be treated with surgery and fertility treatments.

3. Blocked Fallopian Tubes:
Infections like tuberculosis (TB), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), or past surgeries can damage or block the fallopian tubes. If eggs can’t reach the uterus, pregnancy won’t happen. IVF helps bypass this issue by placing embryos directly in the uterus.

4. Poor Egg Quality or Low AMH:
Some women have fewer eggs (low AMH), or the eggs are poor in quality due to age or other reasons. This is common after 35 but can happen earlier too. Egg freezing, IVF with hormone support, or even donor eggs are possible solutions.

5. Thyroid & Hormonal Imbalance:
Hypothyroidism or high prolactin levels can mess with your cycle and ovulation. These can be managed easily with medicines once detected.

6. Lifestyle Issues:
Stress, late-night work, smoking, poor diet, and obesity can all hurt fertility. Many urban women in India face this due to busy schedules and late marriages. A healthy lifestyle improves fertility for both men and women.

7. Unexplained Infertility:
Sometimes, all reports are normal but pregnancy still doesn’t happen. This can be frustrating, but doctors use step-by-step treatments like IUI or IVF to improve chances.

No matter the reason, infertility is not the end. The earlier you act, the better your chances. Tests like AMH, ultrasound, and hormone panels give a clear picture.
